# Spotify Playlist Manager

There's no easy way to reverse the order of playlists in the mobile app (and desktop can only sort by date added, not index) so I wrote a simple Vue app to do this for me.

## Install

1. `git clone git@github.com:codybarr/spotify-playlist-manager.git`
2. `cd spotify-playlist-manager`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn serve`
5. Open `http://localhost:8080`
6. Login and browse playlists, reverse them.
